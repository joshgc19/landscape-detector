## Project description

### Constraints

## Algorithm explanation

### Features chosen
To fully understand the features chosen in the current project, the following features of the type of landscapes that the model will recognize have to be reviewed:
  
  * The picture must have the following hierarchical structure from top to bottom:
    * Blue daylight sky at the top with few clouds.
    * Solid ground must be portrayed with dominance of nature at the middle.
    * Buildings and housing may be present at the middle-bottom level.
  * Bodies of water may not be visible.
  * Depicted nature must be alive or green.
  * No snow coverage must be shown.

Having the characterization of the image detailed, the features chosen to be part of the features vector used throughout the project will be the following:
  * **Sky percentage (SP)**: This feature represents the percentage of the image in which the sky is depicted. For this purpose a 50 stripes gradient must be calculated from top to bottom in search of a delta greater than 65 in _RGB_ scale.
  * **Greeness (G)**: Percentage of green pixels contained in the image, for this project the color green will have the following _RGB_ color bounds: $G_L = (25, 25, 20)$ y $G_U =  (230, 255, 86)$.
  * **Skyness (S)**: Percentage of blueish pixels contained in the image, for this project the color sky or blueish will have the following _RGB_ color bounds: $S_L = (170, 45, 100)$ y $S_U =  (255, 255, 255)$.

And according to the above defined features, the feature vector that will be used is the following:

$$\Vec{F} = (SP, G, S)$$

### Pattern recognition and model calculation algorithm

### Implementation

## Resulting model
As a result of the training stage, two vectors are generated, specifically the average vector ($E(\Vec{F})$) which reflect central tendencies of the datas set and the variance vector ($\sigma_{\Vec{F}}$) which represents the variability across the data set. Both resulting vector are shown down below:
    
$$E(\Vec{F}) = (0.32, 0.3315, 0.2601)$$

$$\sigma_{\Vec{F}} = (0.1841, 0.0540, 0.1428)$$
  
These will be the test subject in the next section.

## Testing

The objetive of testing this project is to validate the accuracy of the generated model. For this, a small dataset is used comprised of 10 high resolution images, which contain 50% landscapes and 50% non-landscape images such as animals or random settings. 

### Results

Using the automated testing process within the recognition module and the dataset detailed in the above section  the following results were found: 

| **Truth Value** | *Absolute Freq.* |
|-----------------|:----------------:|
| True positive   |        3         |
| True negative   |        4         |
| False positive  |        4         |
| False negative  |        2         |

According to the above table, the accuracy of the model is approximately 70%.
